    "This project uses historic Disneyland wait-time data to predict ride popularity tiers (1–5) using machine learning models. The predicted popularity scores are then used to generate an optimized ride plan aimed at maximizing high-tier rides within a single park day.\n"

    "Each ride is assigned a popularity tier from **1 to 5**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5** = most popular / in highest demand  \n",
    "- **1** = least popular / lowest demand  \n",
    "\n",
    "These tiers may be derived from my own personal tier list that I have created.\n",

    "\n",
    "This task is formulated as a **multiclass classification problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input features (X):**  \n",
    "  Quantitative attributes of a ride, such as:  \n",
    "  - Average wait time  \n",
    "  - Maximum wait time  \n",

    "  A discrete popularity tier in **{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}**\n",

    "\n",
    "To align with course content, the project includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **majority-class baseline**  \n",
    "- A **wait-time heuristic baseline** (ranking rides by average wait time)  \n",
    "- A **multinomial logistic regression model**  \n",
    "  - This is the primary ML model used for classification  \n",
    "  - It outputs predicted probabilities for each tier  \n",

    "- **Accuracy**  \n",
    "- **Macro F1-score**  \n",
    "- **Confusion matrix visualization**  \n",
    "  - Helps reveal whether errors occur mostly between adjacent tiers (e.g., 3 ↔ 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance of the logistic regression model will be compared against baselines to demonstrate prediction quality and justify the model’s effectiveness.\n"

    "- Removing rows with missing or invalid wait times  \n",
    "- Filtering out attractions not included in the tier list  \n",
    "- Aggregating data at the **ride level** using summary statistics such as:  \n",
    "  - Mean average wait time  \n",
    "  - Mean maximum wait time  \n",
