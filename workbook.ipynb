    "This project uses historic Disneyland wait-time data to predict ride popularity tiers (1–5) using machine learning models. The predicted popularity scores are then used to generate an optimized ride plan aimed at maximizing high-tier rides within a single park day.\n"

    "Each ride is assigned a popularity tier from **1 to 5**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5** = most popular / in highest demand  \n",
    "- **1** = least popular / lowest demand  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Input features (X):**  \n",
    "  Quantitative attributes of a ride, such as:  \n",
    "  - Average wait time  \n",

    "\n",
    "To align with course content, the project includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **majority-class baseline**  \n",
    "- A **wait-time heuristic baseline** (ranking rides by average wait time)  \n",
    "- A **multinomial logistic regression model**  \n",
    "  - This is the primary ML model used for classification  \n",
    "  - It outputs predicted probabilities for each tier  \n",

    "Model performance will be assessed using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**  \n",
    "- **Macro F1-score**  \n",
    "- **Confusion matrix visualization**  \n",
    "  - Helps reveal whether errors occur mostly between adjacent tiers (e.g., 3 ↔ 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance of the logistic regression model will be compared against baselines to demonstrate prediction quality and justify the model’s effectiveness.\n"
